#summary Introduction to running znc on Windows
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

===System Requirements===

  * Microsoft Windows XP SP 1 or newer
  * Network connection

===First Start (1.x)===
  * Uninstall any earlier ZNC versions
  * Now you have to create a configuration file.
  * Recommended way: use the *ZNC - Create Config File* shortcut from the start menu
  * Manual way: open a new cmd.exe instance, navigate to the `Program Files\ZNC` folder, type `znc_cli.exe --makeconf`, then follow the instructions. When you're done, simply enter `znc_cli` and hit return to start the program.
  * Your configuration is stored in `%appdata%\ZNC` by default.

===Notes===
  * Details about using modules, webadmin and so on can be found on the [http://en.znc.in/wiki/ZNC official ZNC website].
  * You have to keep the console window open. Closing it will shut down ZNC.
  * If you don't like that, you can install ZNC as a Windows service. Refer to [ServiceSetup] for details on how to.
  * As of 22 August 2012, the ZNC_Tray.exe program is still a work in progress!
