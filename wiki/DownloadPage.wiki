== Current Release ==

This is the current work-in-progress ZNC 1.x build for Windows:

  * [http://znc-msvc.irsoft.de/downloads/znc-2014-08-10-setup.exe znc-2014-08-10-setup.exe] (includes updated OpenSSL 1.0.1i)

Please note that the tray application is not considered stable or ready for production yet.

Please post your feedback in the issue tracker.

== "Starting the service failed. Make sure it's installed correctly." ==

The GUI is not yet ready for general use - most likely the ZNC configuration is missing. You have to create a configuration file using the shortcut from the start menu, then move + rename the `%appdata%\ZNC` folder to `C:\ProgramData\ZNC\Configuration` (Windows Vista / Server 2008 and later).
After that, ensure that the Windows Account "_LOCAL SERVICE_" has read and write permissions on the entire folder and its contents.
