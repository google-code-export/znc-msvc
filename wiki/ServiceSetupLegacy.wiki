===Prerequisites===

  * We assume that you installed ZNC according to StarterGuide and that you have a working configuration file.
  * You obviously need administrative privileges.

===Moving the config dir===

First, shut down ZNC if you haven't already.

Then, you have to move the ZNC configuration dir from %appdata% to the ZNC binaries folder. This also means that the user you are going to run ZNC as needs to have write access to the new directory.

The service will not run as your current user (e.g. "Administrator", so it won't find the config in `C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\ZNC`). It will however not even look in that folder if we move+rename the config dir to .znc in the directory where znc.exe resides.

So that's what we're going to do. Move the ZNC folder from %appdata% to your znc.exe dir, then fire up a command prompt and use `rename ZNC .znc` to rename the directory.

The resulting tree should look like this:
{{{
- ZNC
  + modules
  - .znc
    - configs
      znc.conf
  znc.exe
  znc_service.exe
  ...
}}}

===Creating a service===

We use the [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/251192 sc.exe] command line utility to create a service entry for ZNC. This is a basic example:

  `sc create ZNC binPath= "D:\Program Files\ZNC\ZNC_Service.exe"`

Don't forget the space character following `binPath=`.

You probably don't want to start the service immediately. Please read on.

===Event Log integration===

In order to get ZNC logging errors and such to the system event log (eventvwr.msc), we need to register it as an event provider. To do that, open service-event-log.reg.txt from the ZNC distribution, edit the pathes and remove the ## line, then save. Rename the file to .reg and import it into your registry.

===Starting the service===

Use services.msc to configure when the service starts, and to actually start it now.

===Removing the service===

In case you ever want to get rid of the service entry:

  * Execute: `sc delete ZNC`
  * Delete the registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\eventlog\Application\ZNCServiceEventProvider`
